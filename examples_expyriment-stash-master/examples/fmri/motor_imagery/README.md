# Motor Imagery

A simple block design fMRI experiment. Participants are instructed (visually
and auditorily) to alternately rest and imagine swimming. The scanner is
synchronized at the beginning of each block. A 
[BrainVoyager](http://brainvoyager.com) `.prt` file is saved at the end of the
experiment.
